      Recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of quality diversity (QD)
      optimization, a branch of optimization that seeks to find a collection of
      diverse, high-performing solutions to a given problem. To grow further, we
      believe the QD community faces two challenges: developing a framework to
      represent the field's growing array of algorithms, and implementing that
      framework in software that supports a range of researchers and
      practitioners. To address these challenges, we have developed pyribs, a
      library built on a highly modular conceptual QD framework. By replacing
      components in the conceptual framework, and hence in pyribs, users can
      compose algorithms from across the QD literature; equally important, they
      can identify unexplored algorithm variations. Furthermore, pyribs makes
      this framework simple, flexible, and accessible, with a user-friendly API
      supported by extensive documentation and tutorials. This paper overviews
      the creation of pyribs, focusing on the conceptual framework that it
      implements and the design principles that have guided the library's
      development.

        Pyribs implements the RIBS framework for QD optimization. The user first
        <code>ask()</code>'s for solutions from a <b>scheduler</b>.  The
        scheduler selects <b>emitters</b> to <code>ask()</code> for solutions
        and returns the solutions to the user. After evaluating the solutions,
        the user <code>tell()</code>'s the results to the scheduler.  The
        scheduler <code>add()</code>'s the solutions to the <b>archive</b> and
        receives information that it <code>tell()</code>'s to the emitters,
        enabling the emitters to update their internal search state.
